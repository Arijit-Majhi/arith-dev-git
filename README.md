**Repository for practicing Databricks CI/CD with Databricks Asset Bundles (DABs)**

This repository serves as a learning and experimentation ground for implementing Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) workflows for Databricks projects using Databricks Asset Bundles (DABs). The primary focus is on practicing the end-to-end process, from code development to deployment on Databricks.

## Overview

This repository contains a simple job and pipeline development project implemented in Databricks. The goal is to demonstrate how to:

- Structure a Databricks project using DABs.
- Define and manage Databricks resources (notebooks, libraries, etc.) within a bundle.
- Implement a basic CI/CD pipeline for deploying changes to different Databricks environments.
- Utilize Git for version control and collaboration.

This repository is intended for personal learning and may not represent a production-ready setup.
